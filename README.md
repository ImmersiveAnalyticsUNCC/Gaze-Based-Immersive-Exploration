# Gaze-Based-Immersive-Exploration

This project explores the head tracking function on the latest Microsoft HoloLens â€“ where gaze is defined as the ray starting at the head location and points forward. We present a gaze-directed visualization approach to study ensembles of 2D oil spill simulations in mixed reality. Our approach allows users to place an ensemble as an image stack in a real environment and explore the ensemble with gaze tracking. The prototype system demonstrates the challenges and promising effects of gaze-based interaction in the state-of-the-art mixed reality.
